# Scholars Discovery Data

This code just turns a person object (nested as one conceptual model)
into another person object (flattened out to match closer the 
scholars-discovery index document structure).

The purpose of this is to make it a little easier to think about
what object we need to build for input into scholars discovery in 
a more 'natural' way and put off thinking about the less natural
structure that the index document requires

The hope would be eventually this could make it into scholars-discovery
and offer a way to import data into an instance that matches a certain
shape - and by-pass the need for making a json shape that imports
into rdf that then exports out as a json shape again

Since I found it easier to work with Kotlin, and since this is very
provisional - it's in Kotlin - but would probably be easy enough to
convert later, if it gets to that point
